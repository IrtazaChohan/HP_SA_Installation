Written by Irtaza Chohan (http://www.lostintheclouds.net & https://github.com/IrtazaChohan/Align-Crypto-Policy)

You need to supply an IP address of the HP SA control server (that should be setup before this is installed on clients)

This has been tested on:

- Windows Server 2008
- Windows Server 2008 R2
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2019

NOTES:

 1. You need to have Administrative rights on the server to run this script. 
 2. Please provide a logfile path so log path is saved accordingly.
 3. The logPath will also contain the log folder of HP SA.
 4. Ensure that you specify a HP SA server (IP Address) as part of this installation.
